# Lab 01 Reflection

During this lab, I learned how to set up VS Code and Git, create repositories, and manage files through GitHub. I practiced adding, committing, and pushing changes. I also learned how to create and merge branches, which made me understand collaborative workflows better. This lab helped me become more confident with Git and version control systems.
